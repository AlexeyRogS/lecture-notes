    \section{Polar Coordinates in 2D}
        \paragraph{}
        We have studied in great detail the mechanics of objects travelling in straight lines.
        Now we want to extend this to more general situations where objects can move along curved paths.
        We will first study motion in 2D as it is much simpler than 3D.
        As we saw in section~\ref{sec:motion-in-2-3d}, vectors in 2D can be equivalently described by two cartesian components or their length together with the angle they make with the $x$-axis.
        Depending on the type of motion in the problem, it is much simpler to describe the trajectory of an object the latter way.
        These are known as \textbf{polar coordinates}.

        \paragraph{}
        To set up the coordinate system, we define two new coordinate axes relative to the position vector $\vec{r}$.
        The first axis points along the direction of the position vector, and the second points one quarter turn anticlockwise from the first.
        These axes get two orthonormal vectors to form a basis which we label $\uvec{r}$ and $\uvec{\theta}$ respectively.

            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{figure}

        \paragraph{}
        Then a 2D vector $\vec{A}$ has a cartesian representation $\vec{A}=A_x\ihat+A_y\ihat$ and a polar representation $\vec{A}=A_r\uvec{r}+A_\theta\uvec{\theta}$.
        To find the components in one coordinate system using the components in the other, we have to know the relations between all the basis vectors.
        Using trigonometry, we can see that
        \begin{align}
            \uvec{r}&=\cos\theta\ihat+\sin\theta\jhat\label{eq:2d-polar-uvec-r}\\
            \uvec{\theta}&=-\sin\theta\ihat+\cos\theta\jhat\label{eq:2d-polar-uvec-theta}.
        \end{align}
        Substituting this into the polar coordinate representation of $\vec{A}$, we get
        \begin{align}
            \vec{A}&=A_r(\cos\theta\ihat+\sin\theta\jhat)+A_\theta(-\sin\theta\ihat+\cos\theta\jhat)\\
            &=(A_r\cos\theta-A_\theta\sin\theta)\ihat+(A_r\sin\theta+A_\theta\cos\theta)\jhat.
        \end{align}
        Comparing coefficients with the cartesian representation, we see that
        \begin{align}
            A_x&=A_r\cos\theta-A_\theta\sin\theta\\
            A_y&=A_r\sin\theta+A_\theta\cos\theta.
        \end{align}
        By doing the same procedure the other way around, we can deduce that
        \begin{align}
            A_r&=A_x\cos\theta+A_y\sin\theta\\
            A_\theta&=-A_x\sin\theta+A_y\cos\theta.
        \end{align}

        \paragraph{}
        The definition of the axes in polar coordinates may seem confusing at first as the position vector moves around over time.
        This means that the axes and unit vectors also change over time, and we will see how this affects calculation of the motion of an object in the next section.

        \paragraph{}
        Once thing that doesn't change is the representation of the position vector itself, which is always given by $\vec{r}=r\uvec{r}$.
        The conversion between representations of the trajectory in cartesian and polar coordinates is then given by equations~\ref{eq:2d-polar-length}, \ref{eq:2d-polar-x-component}, \ref{eq:2d-polar-y-component}, and \ref{eq:2d-polar-theta}.
        \begin{align}
            x&=r\cos\theta\\
            y&=r\sin\theta\\
            r&=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\
            \tan\theta&=\frac{y}{x}.
        \end{align}

    \section{Angular Kinematics}
        Similar to how we analysed motion along each axis seperately in cartesian coordinates in chapter~\ref{chap:1}, we can do the same thing in polar coordinates, except with some differences.
        In the special case of circular motion, there is no motion in the radial direction and 2D motion is reduced to a 1D problem.
        Displacement has units of length, but angles are unitless, so we will now examine how the angle of the position vector changes over time.
        \begin{definition}
            The \textbf{angular displacement} of an object is the difference in angle to the $x$ axis between two times $t_1$ and $t_2>t_1$.
            \begin{equation}
                \Delta\theta=\theta(t_2)-\theta(t_1)=\theta_2-\theta_1.
            \end{equation}
        \end{definition}
        Now consider the velocity of the object, analogously to the linear case, we can define the angular velocity as the rate of change of angular displacement.
        \begin{definition}
            The \textbf{instananeous angular velocity} of an object is defined as the time derivative of angular displacement.
            \begin{equation}
                \omega(t)=\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{\theta(t+\Delta t)-\theta(t)}{\Delta t}=\dv{\theta(t)}{t}=\dot{\theta}.
            \end{equation}
        \end{definition}
        Likewise, the angular acceleration is given by the rate of change of angular velocity.
        \begin{definition}
            The \textbf{instaneous angular acceleration} of an object is defined as the time derivative of angular velocity.
            \begin{equation}
                \alpha(t)=\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{\omega(t+\Delta t)-\omega(t)}{\Delta t}=\dv{\omega(t)}{t}=\dv[2]{\theta(t)}{t}=\dot{\omega}=\ddot{\theta}.
            \end{equation}
        \end{definition}
        Again analogously to the linear case, we define the average angular velocity and angular acceleration as integrals.
        \begin{align}
            \bar{\omega}(t)&=\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}=\frac{1}{\Delta t}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\omega(t)\dd{t}\\
            \bar{\alpha}(t)&=\frac{\Delta\omega}{\Delta t}=\frac{1}{\Delta t}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\alpha(t)\dd{t}.
        \end{align}

        \paragraph{}
        Now, let us go back to the full 2D vectors and see how they change with time.
        The velocity vector is the time derivative of the position vector:
        \begin{equation}
            \vec{v}=\dv{\vec{r}}{t}=\dv{}{t}(r\uvec{r}).
        \end{equation}
        We need to use the product rule for this since in general both $r$ (the length of the position vector) and $\uvec{r}$ (the direction that the position vector points) change over time.
        What is the time derivative of $\uvec{r}$?
        We can work it out using equation~\ref{eq:2d-polar-uvec-r}:
        \begin{align}
            \dv{\uvec{r}}{t}&=\dv{}{t}\cos\theta\ihat+\dv{}{t}\sin\theta\jhat\\
            &=-\dot{\theta}\sin\theta\ihat+\dot{\theta}\cos\theta\jhat\\
            &=\omega(-\sin\theta\ihat+\cos\theta\jhat)\\
            &=\omega\uvec{\theta}\label{eq:2d-polar-uvec-r-dot},
        \end{align}
        where we have used equation~\ref{eq:2d-polar-uvec-theta} to substitute $\uvec{\theta}$ in the last line.
        We can work out the time derivative of $\uvec{\theta}$ now as well, it is
        \begin{align}
            \dv{\uvec{\theta}}{t}&=-\dv{}{t}\sin\theta\ihat+\dv{}{t}\cos\theta\jhat\\
            &=-\dot{\theta}\cos\theta\ihat-\dot{\theta}\sin\theta\jhat\\
            &=-\omega\uvec{r}.\label{eq:2d-polar-uvec-theta-dot}
        \end{align}
        As an aside, think about why these two results make physical sense.
        Why should the rate of change of $\uvec{r}$ be in the $\uvec{\theta}$ direction?

        \paragraph{}
        We can now finish off calculating the velocity vector:
        \begin{align}
            \vec{v}&=\dot{r}\uvec{r}+r\dv{\uvec{r}}{t}\\
            &=\dot{r}\uvec{r}+r\omega\uvec{\theta}.\label{eq:2d-polar-velocity}
        \end{align}
        We label the component pointing along the radial direction $v_r=\dot{r}$ and call it the \textbf{radial velocity}, and the component pointing along $\uvec{\theta}$, $v_\theta=r\omega$, is the \textbf{tangential velocity}. 
        
        \paragraph{}
        The benefit of using the $\uvec{r}-\uvec{\theta}$ axes with polar coordinates is immediately apparent.
        Using the cartesian coordinate axes, the position vector is given by $\vec{r}=r\cos\theta\ihat+r\sin\theta\jhat$, so the time derivative is
        \begin{align}
            \vec{v}=\dv{\vec{r}}{t}&=(\dot{r}\cos\theta-r\omega\sin\theta)\ihat+(\dot{r}\sin\theta+r\omega\cos\theta)\jhat\label{eq:2d-polar-velocity-cartesian}\\
            &=\dot{r}(\cos\theta\ihat+\sin\theta\jhat)+r\omega(-\sin\theta\ihat+\cos\theta\jhat)\\
            &=\dot{r}\uvec{r}+r\omega\uvec{\theta}.
        \end{align}
        In the last two lines we have regrouped the terms to write $\vec{v}$ in the $\uvec{r}-\uvec{\theta}$ basis and recovered our previous result.
        In the cartesian coordinate system, we get $v_x=\dot{r}\cos\theta-r\omega\sin\theta$ and $v_y=\dot{r}\sin\theta+r\omega\cos\theta$ which is rather opaque to interpretation.

        \paragraph{}
        Now, let's calculate the acceleration vector in polar coordinates.
        \begin{align}
            \vec{a}=\dv{\vec{v}}{t}&=\dv{}{t}(\dot{r}\uvec{r}+r\omega\uvec{\theta})\\
            &=\ddot{r}\uvec{r}+\dot{r}\dv{\uvec{r}}{t}+\dot{r}\dot{\theta}\uvec{\theta}+r\ddot{\theta}\uvec{\theta}+r\dot{\theta}\dv{\uvec{\theta}}{t}\\
            &=\ddot{r}\uvec{r}+\dot{r}\dot{\theta}\uvec{\theta}+\dot{r}\dot{\theta}\uvec{\theta}+r\ddot{\theta}\uvec{\theta}-r\dot{\theta}^2\uvec{\theta}\\
            &=(\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}^2)\uvec{r}+(2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}+r\ddot{\theta})\uvec{\theta}.\label{eq:2d-polar-acceleration}
        \end{align}
        Therefore, the radial acceleration is $a_r=\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}^2$, and the tangential acceleration is $a_\theta= 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}+r\ddot{\theta}$.

        \paragraph{}
        Here is an important thing to note about using polar coordinates.
        Although the unit vectors change over time, the reference frame is inertial.
        Our perspective is fixed, it does not move or co-rotate with the coordinate system.
        This an lead to some, at first counterintuitive, results compared to cartesian coordinates.
        One may assume that if there is no force in the radial direction, then there is no acceleration in the radial direction and $\ddot{r}=0$.
        However, as we see above, the radial component of the acceleration vector, which takes into account the change of the unit vectors over time, is $a_r=\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}^2$.
        The radial component of acceleration is \textit{not} the derivative of radial velocity, $\dot{r}$.
        This can be confusing because it implies that if $F_r=0$ and so $a_r=0$ by Newton's second law, then there can still be motion in the radial direction $\ddot{r}\neq0$.
        We will now look at an example to illustrate this.

        \begin{example}
            Consider a bead which is free to move along a frictionless rod.
            The rod is anchored at one end and is rotating at constant angular velocity $\omega$.
            As the rod rotates, the bead will swing out to the end of the rod.
            Before it reaches the end, what does its motion look like?

                    \node[right] at (39.8:1.1) {$\omega$};

                    \begin{scope}[shift={(0.8,0.8)},scale=0.25,rotate=39.8,font=\small]

                        \node[right] at (1,0) {$\uvec{r}$};

                    \end{scope}
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{figure}

            \paragraph{}
            Since the total force on the bead is $\vec{F}=F_\text{rod}\uvec{\theta}$, the instantaneous radial acceleration $a_r=\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}^2$ must be zero.
            This is a differential equation that we can solve for the radial motion.
            \begin{equation}
                \dv[2]{r}{t}-\omega^2r=0.
            \end{equation}
            Using an ansatz of the form $r=Ae^{Bt}$, with two unknown constants $A$ and $B$, we get
            \begin{align}
                &\dv[2]{}{t}(Ae^{Bt})-\omega^2Ae^{Bt}=0\\
                &AB^2e^{Bt}-\omega^2Ae^{Bt}=0\\
                &B^2-\omega^2=0.
            \end{align}
            This gives $B=\pm\omega$, so we get the general solution
            \begin{equation}
                r=A_+e^{\omega t}+A_-e^{-\omega t}.
            \end{equation}
            When $t=0$, $r$ is some value $r_0$ and $\dot{r}=0$, so
            \begin{align}
                \dot{r}(0)&=\left.A_+\omega e^{\omega t}-A_-\omega e^{-\omega t}\right|_{t=0}\\
                &=\omega(A_+-A_-)=0,
            \end{align}
            therefore $A_+=A_-=$, so we will relabel them both $A$.
            Finally, $r(0)=2A=r_0$, so we have
            \begin{align}
                r&=\frac{1}{2}r_0(e^{\omega t}+e^{-\omega t})\\
                &=r_0\cosh(\omega t).
            \end{align}
            % TODO: add plot of radial motion
        \end{example}

    \section{Constant Angular Acceleration}
        \paragraph{}
        In the case where we have a constant angular acceleration, we can derive a set of equations analogous to the SUVAT equations for linear motion derived in section~\ref{sec:suvat}.
        From the equation for average acceleration above, we get
        \begin{align}
            \Delta\omega=\omega(t)-\omega_0&=\alpha t\\
            \omega(t)&=\omega_0+\alpha t,\label{eq:ang-suvat-1}
        \end{align}
        which is analogous to equation~\ref{eq:suvat-1}.
        Then from the definition of angular displacement,
        \begin{align}
            \Delta\theta&=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}(\omega_0+\alpha t)\dd{t}\\
            &=\omega_0t+\frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2\\
            \implies\theta(t)&=\theta_0+\omega_0t+\frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2.\label{eq:ang-suvat-2}
        \end{align}
        This is like equation~\ref{eq:suvat-2}
        Finally, squaring equation~\ref{eq:ang-suvat-1} and substituting it into equation~\ref{eq:ang-suvat-2} gives the last equation:
        \begin{equation}
            \omega^2(t)=\omega_0^2+2\alpha\theta(t),\label{eq:ang-suvat-3}
        \end{equation}
        which is an angular version of equation~\ref{eq:suvat-3}.
        These equations are useful in solving problems where we don't have to worry (or don't care) about motion in the radial direction.

    \section{Uniform Circular Motion}
        % TODO: move this section to the beginning of this chapter?
        \paragraph{}
        The simplest case of angular motion is where an object is moving in a circle, so there is no motion in the radial direction, and going at a constant speed.
        This is called \textbf{uniform circular motion}, and objects moving this way can be analysed using 1D techniques we studied in section~\ref{sec:motion-in-1d}.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
                \draw[->] (-1,0) -- (1,0);
                \draw[->] (0,-1) -- (0,1);
                \draw[dashed] (0,0) circle [radius=0.8];
                \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (0.6,0.53);
                \fill (0.6,0.53) circle [radius=0.02];
                \draw (0.2,0) arc [radius=0.2, start angle=0, end angle=39.8];
                \draw[->,rotate=30] (1,0) arc [radius=1, start angle=0, end angle=20];
                \node[right] at (1,0) {$x$};
                \node[above] at (0,1) {$y$};
                \node at (0.25,0.1) {$\theta$};
                \node[above] at (0.3,0.265) {$r$};
                \node[right] at (39.8:1.1) {$\dot{\theta}=\omega$};
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{figure}
        First, note that the displacement is the arc length of the circular path, given by $s=r\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angular displacement in radians and $r$ is the radius of the circle.
        Thus, the velocity along the path is given as
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:ucm-speed}
            v=\dv{s}{t}=r\dv{\theta}{t}=r\omega.
        \end{equation}
        Since the speed is constant, $\omega$ is constant as well.
        Therefore, by equation~\ref{eq:ang-suvat-2}, we have $\theta=\omega t$.

        \paragraph{}
        Does this mean acceleration is zero?
        No.
        Since $\omega$ is constant, $\alpha=\dot{\omega}=0$, but this does not mean that the linear acceleration is zero.
        Recall Newton's first law of motion, definition~\ref{def:newton-1}: if the \textit{velocity} is constant, the force (acceleration) is zero.
        Since the path of motion is a circle, the velocity vector is constantly changing direction and is therefore \textit{not} constant.

        \paragraph{}
        We will calculate the velocity and accelearation in cartesian coordinates first.
        Taking equation~\ref{eq:2d-polar-velocity-cartesian} and dropping the terms with $\dot{r}$, we get
        \begin{align}
            \vec{v}&=-r\omega\sin(\omega t)\ihat+r\omega\cos(\omega t)\jhat\\
            \vec{a}&=\dv{\vec{v}}{t}\\
            &=-r\omega^2\cos(\omega t)\ihat-r\omega^2\sin(\omega t)\jhat.
        \end{align}
        As a sanity check, we can see that the speed is given by
        \begin{align}
            \abs{\vec{v}}&=\sqrt{(-r\omega\sin(\omega t))^2+(r\omega\cos(\omega t))^2}\\
            &=\sqrt{r^2\omega^2(\sin^2(\omega t)+\cos^2(\omega t))}\\
            &=r\omega,
        \end{align}
        which is what we found before.
        It is not immediately clear in this coordinate system which direction the velocity points in, let's calculate the dot product with the position vector to find out.
        \begin{align}
            \vec{v}\cdot\vec{r}&=(-r\omega\sin(\omega t)\ihat+r\omega\cos(\omega t)\jhat)\cdot(r\cos(\omega t)\ihat+r\sin(\omega t)\jhat)\\
            &=-r^2\omega\sin(\omega t)\cos(\omega t)+r^2\omega\sin(\omega t)\cos(\omega t)\\
            &=0.
        \end{align}
        Hence the velocity and position vectors are perpendicular.
        This makes sense because as we know from section~\ref{sec:motion-in-2-3d}, the velocity is always tangent to the trajectory, which corresponds to being perpendicular to the position vector in the case of a circle.

        \paragraph{}
        Finally, notice that since $\vec{r}=r\sin(\omega t)\ihat+r\cos(\omega t)\jhat$,
        \begin{equation}
            \vec{a}=-\omega^2\vec{r}.
        \end{equation}
        The acceleration is antiparallel to the position vector, pointing in towards the centre of the circle.
        The magnitude of the acceleration is
        \begin{align}
            \abs{\vec{a}}&=\abs{-\omega^2}\abs{\vec{r}}\\
            &=r\omega^2\\
            &=\frac{v^2}{r},
        \end{align}
        where we have substituted equation~\ref{eq:ucm-speed} in the last line
        Thus the magnitude of the acceleration is constant, but the direction changes as the object moves on its circular path.
        By Newton's second law, a nonzero acceleration implies an unbalanced force.
        This force is what keeps the object moving on its circular path and is known as the \textbf{centripetal force}.
        It is given by
        \begin{equation}
            \vec{F}_\text{centripetal}=m\vec{a}=-mr\omega^2\uvec{r}=-\frac{mv^2}{r}\uvec{r}.
        \end{equation}

        \paragraph{}
        Let us see if we can reproduce these results using the 2D polar coordinate vectors.
        Using equation~\ref{eq:2d-polar-velocity} and noting that $r$ is constant, we immediately recover
        \begin{equation}
            \vec{v}=r\omega\uvec{\theta}.
        \end{equation}
        Here it is immediately apparent that the velocity always points perpendicular to the position vector.
        In equation~\ref{eq:2d-polar-acceleration}, any time derivatives of $r$ drop out, as well as $\ddot{\theta}$, leaving us with
        \begin{equation}
            \vec{a}=-r\dot{\theta}^2\uvec{r},
        \end{equation}
        which is the same as above.       
        
        \begin{example}
            Consider a child on a merry-go-round.
            If the platform is rotating at 60rpm and the child is holding on, what is the force on the child's arm?

        This next example uses the concept of energy conservation in combination with the traditional method of comparing forces to solve the problem.
        \begin{example}
            Consider a mass on a string.
            The mass starts hanging vertically downwards, then it gets projected sideways at a speed $v_0$.
            When the angle between the string and the vertical is $120^\circ$, the string becomes slack and the mass falls.
            Find the initial speed $v_0$ in terms of the length of the string.
            % TODO: complete this example
            First use energy conservation to relate the change in kinetic energy to the change in gravitational potential energy.
            % TODO: explain why this is valid since gravitational force is conservative and centripetal force doesn't change magnitude of velocity
            Then evaluate the forces at the top of the path to get a formula for the final velocity.
            Finally use the conservation of energy to solve for $v_0$.

            How fast would the mass haves to be projected to get to the top of the loop?

    \section{Rigid Body Rotation}
        \paragraph{}
        % TODO: introduce moment of inertia for a single particle first
        A rigid body is a system of particles which are fixed together such that they move together, no matter the forces applied.
        We have seen in previous chapters that it is possible to treat rigid bodies as point masses when considering linear motion.
        However, when considering rotational effects as well, we need to consider the macroscopic extent of an object.
        Consider a rigid body in motion and look at the total kinetic energy, which is given by the sum of kinetic energy of each constituent particle:
        \begin{equation}
            K=\sum_i\frac{1}{2}m_i\vec{v}_i\cdot\vec{v}_i.
        \end{equation}
        We can split the velocity of each particle into the sum of velocity around the centre of rotation and velocity along the line of motion.
        \begin{align}
            K&=\sum_i\frac{1}{2}m_i(\vec{v}_{i,\text{rot}}+\vec{v}_{i,\text{lin}})^2\\
            &=\sum_i\frac{1}{2}m_i(v_{i,\text{rot}}^2+v_{i,\text{lin}}^2+2\vec{v}_{i,\text{rot}}\cdot\vec{v}_{i,\text{lin}})\\
            &=\underbrace{\sum_i\frac{1}{2}m_iv_{i,\text{rot}}^2}_{K_\text{rotational}}+\underbrace{\sum_i\frac{1}{2}m_iv_{i,\text{lin}}^2}_{K_\text{linear}}.
        \end{align}
        The cross-term in the square cancels out (why?).
        % TODO: explain this fully
        % TODO: include a diagram of this
        This rotational kinetic energy can be written in terms of the angular velocity $\omega$ since it is the same for each particle in a rigid body.
        \begin{align}
            K_\text{rot}&=\sum_i\frac{1}{2}m_iv_{i,\text{rot}}^2=\sum_i\frac{1}{2}m_i(r_i\omega)^2\\
            &=\frac{1}{2}\omega^2\sum_i m_ir_i^2\\
            &=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2.
        \end{align}
        $I$ is called the \textbf{moment of inertia}, and it is kind of an angular equivalent of mass.
        Notice how it is calculated in a similar way to the centre of mass except with the square of $r$.
        Also notice how in the formula for $K_\text{rot}$, $I$ and $\omega$ play the role of $m$ and $v$ respectively, which shows how they are analogous to the linear quantities.
        However $I$, just like the centre of mass, depends on how the mass is distributed in an object.
        For example, consider a solid disc and a hoop of the same mass.
        % TODO: include a diagram for this
        From the formula for $I$, we can see that since all of the mass in the hoop is concentrated further out, the moment of inertia will be larger than the disc.
        This means that for the same angular velocity, the rotational kinetic energy of the hoop will be larger than the disc.
        $I$ also depends on the axis of rotation.
